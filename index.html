                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <div class="boarder"></div>
                <p>I am a college student earning my bachelor’s degree in computer science, while also completing a boot camp for UX/UI Design at the University of Texas in Austin. I am originally from Chicago but currently based out of Austin, TX. I specialize in visual design, digital experiences, as well as coding across the web and mobile platforms. I am excited and inspired by the constantly shifting technological landscape, and I strive to one day become apart of the technology industry. I enjoy solving problems for users, such as taking on a task to make the use of an application as user-friendly as possible. I desire to find integrative approaches to creating digital products and experiences that fulfill and exceed aesthetic expectations, user functionalists, and business objectives. In my spare time, you can find me painting, cooking authentic Asian cuisine with my mother, or playing ball with my puppy named Coco. I am also a massive fan of the outdoors, so any chance I get, I will be out in the Texas heat cooling down by paddle boarding, floating, or taking a hike through a shaded area.</p>

                <p class="DW">Due to my love for design and my background in coding, I have grown to appreciate the visual representation of design work. Throughout my bootcamp I developed advanced level skills in Adobe XD and Visual Studios. This has helped me during the development of hi-fi prototypes in UX design and practice in development . I further my education in design as well as the front-end development of code in HTML + CSS.</p>
